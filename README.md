# CSC510 Software Engineering Posters - Spring 2025

Welcome to the repository for CSC510 Software Engineering Posters for the Spring 2025 semester. 
This repository is designed to serve as a central hub where students can upload and share their project posters for the class. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories, one for each project:

- `Project_1/`: Contains posters for the first project.
- `Project_2/`: Contains posters for the second project.
- `Project_3/`: Contains posters for the third project.

Please ensure you upload your poster to the appropriate project directory.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **File Format**: Posters should be submitted in PDF format.
2. **File Naming Convention**: Use the format `GroupName_PosterTitle.pdf` (e.g., `Group1_Popcorn.pdf`).
3. **Directory**: Ensure you upload your file to the correct project directory (`Project_1`, `Project_2`, or `Project_3`).
4. **Commit Message**: Include a meaningful commit message when submitting your poster (e.g., `Added Group_100 poster for Project 1`).
